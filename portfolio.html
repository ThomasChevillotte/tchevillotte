		                <p class="project-desc">This project focused on image processing, specifically working with the PPM image format. The project began with a thorough understanding of the PPM format, leading to the development of functions to read, manipulate, and create PPM files. A wide range of image processing features were implemented, including basic tasks like black and white conversion and binarization, as well as more complex transformations like rotation, symmetry, and zooming. Advanced techniques such as convolution for edge detection, blurring, erosion, and dilation were also explored. Filters could be applied using specific commands, and the program was designed to process image data efficiently, generating visually accurate and modified outputs. </p>

		                <p class="project-desc">This project involved analyzing and visualizing large sets of meteorological data, with over 2 million entries processed. A combination of a C program and a Bash script allowed users to filter data by various criteria such as date, geographical coordinates, or specific regions. The program calculated statistical metrics like averages, minimums, and maximums for variables such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed. The processed data was then visualized through custom graphs, offering users clear insights into weather patterns and trends. Challenges included handling large datasets efficiently and ensuring the output was both accurate and user-friendly to allow the user to read it.</p>

		                <p class="project-desc">This project consisted of developing two personal web applications to explore front-end and back-end development. The first, "Pokee," was a food ordering site where users could customize pokebowls by selecting ingredients and submitting orders. The second, "Neuver," was a music platform featuring a login system for users and administrators. Users could search for tracks in the database, while administrators managed artists and music entries. Both projects emphasized user-friendly designs, dynamic content updates, and responsive interfaces. These applications showcased skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and database integration, while also prioritizing intuitive user experiences and efficient functionality.</p>

		                <p class="project-desc">This project aimed to enhance the functionality of an existing website for a French association by creating two new interactive pages. The first page presented an overview of key information with an interactive map and filtering options, enabling users to locate relevant data efficiently. The second page was a catalog of training courses, featuring a well-organized and visually clear model training page. A significant challenge was ensuring that the website remained fully editable by the association, allowing them to update content independently without requiring technical expertise. This project highlighted the importance of usability, accessibility, and maintaining a balance between functionality and design in web development.</p>

Key features included subscription plans, customizable user profiles, photo uploads, and an advanced search engine to help users find matches based on specific criteria. A real-time messaging system was integrated to facilitate communication between users, while administrators could manage profiles, moderate reported messages, and enforce bans through a dedicated dashboard. The project emphasized robust database design, ensuring efficient data handling and security, while also focusing on creating a seamless and engaging user experience. The website demonstrated expertise in full-stack development and system architecture.</p>

		                <p class="project-desc">This project focused on creating an advanced image morphing application as part of a major Java project. A user-friendly interface was developed to separate visual components from the underlying data and calculation processes. Extensive research into the mathematical principles of morphing informed the implementation of methods based on user-defined control points. The application generated smooth frame-by-frame morph animations, which were combined into GIF files for easy sharing and visualization. Challenges included optimizing the morphing algorithm for efficiency and ensuring the interface was intuitive for users, combining mathematical concepts with software engineering to deliver a fully functional application.</p>
