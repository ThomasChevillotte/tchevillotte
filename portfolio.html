                            <p class="project-desc">This was a project where we were able to work on image processing, with the aim of applying various filters to PPM images. After learning about the PPM format, we created functions for reading and creating PPM files, then we moved on to the image processing itself. We created various image processing functions, such as black and white, binarization, rotation and symetry. We also worked on convolution processes, using the mathematical tools we had learned, and other functionalities such as zooming, blurring, erosion and dilation. The user could call up each filter via a specific command, then the program would process the image by applying the formulas to the input image data, then save the new image.</p>

                        <p class="project-desc">The aim of the project was to process meteorological data into graphs for visualization. To achieve this, we had to create a C program and a bash script. With the script, the user could select the input file or call up various filter functions, such as date, geographical coordinates or geographical area. The program processed a variety of data, such as temperatures, pressures, speeds and geographic coordinates, altitudes and various rates. On average, the program processed over 2 million pieces of data, calculating averages, minimums and maximums, and sorting them chronologically or by user-selected criteria. After processing, the script generated graphs, enabling the user to visualize the data clearly.</p>

The first, "pokee", is a food ordering site, where you select the number of ingredients you'd like to add to your pokebowl, then choose them before entering your order details. I tried to add an artistic touch to this project, creating an authentic design, and trying to limit the content on the screen, to keep it minimalist. The second is a music site, called "neuver" (a pun on the French site deezer) with a login system: the administrator manages the artists and music in the database, and the user can log in to search for music in the database. Here again, I wanted to create a simple, uncluttered design, while adding a few extra features.</p>

                        <p class="project-desc">This project was the first school project where we worked for a real company. In this case, it was a French association working for the justice system. We had to create two pages to be included in their website, to simplify the user experience. We started by creating a page summarizing useful information for users, and adding a major feature, a map, accompanied by a search bar and filters, enabling them to easily find information relating to their location. The second page was a catalog of training courses offered by the association, so we created a model training page, which was also designed to be clearer to facilitate the user experience. The major challenge of this project was that the entire site had to be editable by the association.</p>

We were able to apply the knowledge we'd learned in SQL, which enabled us to create a suitable database for the site. We developed several features such as different subscriptions, editable profiles, photo uploads, visits by other users, and an advanced search engine. One of the main features was instant messaging, which enabled subscribers to send and receive messages from other people. In addition, administrators could access a dashboard, providing access to all users' profiles and messaging, as well as the option of banning a user. In addition, they had access to the list of messages reported by users, enabling them to delete them, or even ban the user who had sent them.</p>

                        <p class="project-desc">Our first real java project, where we developed an image morphing application. We started by developing the user interface, following a model that clearly separated the visual, data and calculation parts. We then spent some time researching and understanding the mathematical requirements of the application, enabling us to implement the various image morphing methods. After that, we were able to link the interface part to the calculation part, to obtain functional morphs. These were based on control points set by the user, which defined the characteristics of the image to be morphed. The application then generated the morphing animation, applying the morph frame by frame, then combining it all into a GIF file.</p>
